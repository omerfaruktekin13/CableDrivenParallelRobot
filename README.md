## Description
Cable-driven parallel robots use cables in place of rigid legs to control the end-effector position. These cables can pull the end-effector but they can not push. Cable-driven parallel robots are used in various work fields these days. The manufacturing areas in the factories are one of the places where they are used the CDPR. Cable-driven robots can work in larger operational areas, they provide high ease of transport and it is easy to assembly and disassembly these robots. Cables also provide high speed. In addition to that, using cables in the robot structure introduces new challenging situations in the study of cable-driven parallel robots. I created the simulation of this mechanism. The Simulink model calculates the angles of every stepper motor and cable length for desired end-effector positions. You can see the animation of the system thanks to Simulink 3D Animation.

## Installation
> 1. Download CDPRm.m and CDPRSim.slx files.
> 2. Put these files into your MATLAB folder which is located in Documents.
> 3. Open the .m file and Simulink model. Then enter your desired end-effector location .m file. (You can skip this stage and enter values in Simulink Model directly.)
> 4. Play the Simulink model and you will see the calculation of the cable lengths in display units.
> 5. Select the animation and click ctrl+shift+x (It will activate the subsystem) and play the animation.
